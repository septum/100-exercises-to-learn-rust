# 100 Exercises to Learn Rust

My solutions to the [100 Exercises to Learn Rust](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust).

## Bonus Exercises

- [Version Numbers](exercises/07_threads/11_version_numbers/)
- [Async Aware Primitives Without Tokio](exercises/08_futures/06_async_aware_primitives_no_tokio/)

## Additional Notes

### Using `just`

I used [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) and [`cargo watch`](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch) to speed up the feedback cycle that [`wr`](https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-workshop-runner) provides (see [Justfile](Justfile)).

### No `08_futures/09_outro` (yet)

I want to make a standalone repo for the final project to experiment with it and keep learning. Not today, though.
